Zbox is a zero-details, privacy-focused embeddable file system. Its goal is
to help application store files securely, privately and reliably. By
encapsulating files and directories into an encrypted repository, it provides
a virtual file system and exclusive access to authorised application.

Unlike other system-level file systems, such as [ext4], [XFS] and [Btrfs], which
provide shared access to multiple processes, Zbox is a file system that runs
in the same memory space as the application. It only provides access to one
process at a time.

By abstracting IO access, Zbox supports a variety of underlying storage layers.
Memory and OS file system are supported now, RDBMS and key-value object store
supports are coming soon.

## Disclaimer

Zbox is under active development, we are not responsible for any data loss
or leak caused by using it. Always back up your files and use at your own risk!

Features
========
- Everything is encrypted :lock:, including metadata and directory structure,
  no knowledge can be leaked to underlying storage
- State-of-the-art cryptography: AES-256-GCM (hardware), XChaCha20-Poly1305,
  Argon2 password hashing and etc., empowered by [libsodium]
- Content-based data chunk deduplication and file-based deduplication
- Data compression using [LZ4] in fast mode
- Data integrity is guaranteed by authenticated encryption primitives (AEAD
  crypto)
- File contents versioning
- Copy-on-write (COW :cow:) semantics
- ACID transactional operations
- Snapshot :camera:
- Support multiple storages, including memory, OS file system, RDBMS (coming
  soon), Key-value object store (coming soon) and more
- Built with [Rust] :hearts:

## Comparison

Many OS-level file systems support encryption, such as [EncFS], [APFS] and
[ZFS]. Some disk encryption tools also provide virtual file system, such as
[TrueCrypt] and [VeraCrypt].

This diagram shows the difference between Zbox and them.

How to use
==========
For reference documentation, please visit [documentation](https://docs.rs/zbox).

## Requirements

- [Rust] stable >= 1.21
- [libsodium] >= 1.0.15

## Supported Platforms

- 64-bit Debian-based Linux, such as Ubuntu
- 64-bit macOS

32-bit OS and Windows are `NOT` supported yet.

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
zbox = "~0.1"
```

## Example

```rust
extern crate zbox;

use std::io::{Read, Write};
use zbox::{init_env, RepoOpener, OpenOptions};

fn main() {
    // initialise zbox environment, called first
    init_env();

    // create and open a repository in current OS directory
    let mut repo = RepoOpener::new()
        .create(true)
        .open("file://./my_repo", "your password")
        .unwrap();

    // create and open a file in repository for writing
    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .create(true)
        .open(&mut repo, "/my_file.txt")
        .unwrap();

    // use std::io::Write trait to write data into it
    file.write_all(b"Hello, world!").unwrap();

    // finish writing to make a permanent version of content
    file.finish().unwrap();

    // read file content using std::io::Read trait
    let mut content = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut content).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(content, "Hello, world!");
}
```

## Build with Docker

Zbox comes with Docker support, it is based on [rust:latest] and [libsodium] is
included. Check the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for the details.

First, we build the Docker image which can be used to compile Zbox, run below
commands from Zbox project folder.
```bash
docker build --force-rm -t zbox ./
```

After the Docker image is built, we can use it to build Zbox.
```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/zbox zbox cargo build
```

Or run the test suite.
```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/zbox zbox cargo test
```

## Static linking with libsodium

By default, Zbox uses dynamic linking when it is linked with libsodium. If you
want to change this behavior and use static linking, you can enable below two
environment variables.

```bash
export SODIUM_LIB_DIR=/path/to/your/libsodium/lib
export SODIUM_STATIC=true
```

And then re-build the code.

```bash
cargo build
```
